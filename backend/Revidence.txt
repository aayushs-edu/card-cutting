“That is a projection, so we will find out if it’s accurate as things go on,” Lipsitch said. “It is the best estimate that I’ve been able to make based on a combination of the mathematical models that we use to track and predict epidemics.”	0.7879355639365754
“I think there’s real reason for people to be concerned,” he said. “I also think that we can turn that concern into actions that will make the situation better.”	1.215357914735781
He emphasized that the risk of infection appears to increase with age and encouraged viewers to stay home if they are feeling sick. But he added that the coronavirus outbreak is “not an existential threat.”	1.0099153753803567
“This is, qualitatively, it’s very much like a bad pandemic of influenza, which we experienced arguably twice or three times in the 20th century,” Lipsitch said. “It’s worse than the one that we experienced in 2009. But none of those brought civilization close to its knees.”	0.77098939249968
The coronavirus has infected at least 101 people in the U.S., causing at least six deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. 	0.6470133051924889
